# Dark Mode

This project was created within the [React Framework.](https://react.dev/)
## About the program

**Genesis** is an 20+ year old legacy system designed for customer sales transactions, special ordering, receiving purchase orders, and generating business reports. The old DOS system is outdated and not user-friendly, so a predecessor to the legacy system is created quickly while the company is transitioning to their **new** all-in-one suite, MRV.

**Dark Mode** is the user-friendly graphical application of the Genesis DOS legacy system. It's features or *greenscreens* are the most needed features for stores that MRV has not implemented yet into their application. 

> NOTE: This is purely a front-end demonstration of a graphical version of Genesis. There are no back-end functionalities at this time!!
